## 🌟 Value Proposition

Stop improvising with group money. CheMango gives you a secure vault, a clear approval workflow, and smart strategies that optimize returns with minimal effort and maximum security.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Create a Vault**: Spin up a non-custodial group vault. Add members and set multisig rules (e.g., 2-of-3, 3-of-5).
2. **Fund the Vault**: Deposit supported stablecoins or tokens on the chosen network.
3. **Vote & Approve**: Propose actions (deposit/withdraw/strategy change). Members vote; once the threshold is met, it executes on-chain.
4. **Earn & Monitor**: Allocate into automated DeFi strategies. Track PnL, APY, and risk signals live; withdraw anytime per vault policy.

## 🧩 Core Features

- **Multisig Security**: Every move requires the configured number of approvals. No unilateral actions.
- **Shared Governance**: Members vote on strategies, allocations, and withdrawals.
- **Automated Strategies**: Auto-rebalance, auto-compound, and built-in risk controls.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Live performance, positions, fees, and on-chain tx history.
- **Absolute Transparency**: Every action is recorded on-chain; members see everything.
- **Notifications**: Alerts for proposals, approvals, and threshold reached.

## 📈 Investment Strategies

- **Conservative**: Stablecoin lending and low-volatility yield. (4-6% APY, Low risk, High liquidity)
- **Balanced**: Mix of lending, LP positions, and conservative staking. (7-12% APY, Medium risk/liquidity)
- **Dynamic**: Higher-yield opportunities with tighter risk controls. (10-18% APY, Higher risk, Variable liquidity)
- **Custom**: Bring your own strategy and governance rules.

> **You keep absolute control over where to invest. The group decides, the contract enforces.**
